ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @G-Nils.

I am interested in cybersecurity, reverse engineering and binary exploittion, so most of the stuff in here is related to one of these topics. 
If not stated otherwise, everything is for educational purposes only ;)

I am **not** a software developer, so all my code should be met with a healthy dose of skepticism.
